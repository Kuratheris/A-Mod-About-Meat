Always dreamed of making things out of raw flesh ? Now you can !
Should be mod-friendly 

Including :

- Meat Cubes : Carefully carved meat at the butchery table, base material for the rest of the mod
(As eatable as any other food now :D)
(also usefull for stacking different animal meats together)
- Flesh Walls : They are weak, ugly and smelly.
- Hardened Meat Walls : They're kinda strong, but, hey, that's still meat.
- Raw Flesh Floor : Plant can grow on that one, tho only at 70% speed. Usefull for early indoor crops, before hydroponics.
- Meat Tiles : Meat floor, with a brick pattern. Not too ugly (which is a miracle).
- Human meat variant for everything, let's make prisons out of prisoners !
- Meat plants, too huge for hydroponics, lvl 10 to grow, but give cubes of meats on harvest. It's a freaking plant growing meat cube guys.
- Research tree ! :D
- Some meat furnitures (there will be more in the future), so you can make this bad prisoner sleep in a bed made out of his family C:
- Meat sculptures, let's break the codes with some modern art

Incoming :

A very long list, that you can find there :
